# N8N Encryption Key Configuration
# 
# This file shows how to set up the encryption key for n8n.
# The encryption key is CRITICAL for credential security and portability.
#
# IMPORTANT: The same encryption key MUST be used on both source and destination
# instances for credentials to work properly after migration.

# Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
# Set this in your shell profile or system environment
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-encryption-key-here"

# Method 2: Docker Environment Variable
# Add this to your docker-compose.yml or docker run command
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key-here

# Method 3: Create a secure key file (Advanced)
# Store the key in a secure file and source it
echo "your-32-character-encryption-key-here" > ~/.n8n_encryption_key
chmod 600 ~/.n8n_encryption_key
export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(cat ~/.n8n_encryption_key)

# Generating a new encryption key (if starting fresh):
# You can generate a secure 32-character key using:
# openssl rand -hex 16
# or
# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(16).toString('hex'))"

# SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Never commit the actual key to version control
# 2. Store the key securely and back it up separately
# 3. Use the same key across all n8n instances that need to share credentials
# 4. If you lose the key, encrypted credentials cannot be recovered

# Example of a properly formatted key (DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE):
# N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY="a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"

# For Docker Compose, your environment section might look like:
# environment:
#   - N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key-here
#   - N8N_HOST=localhost
#   - N8N_PORT=5678
#   - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
